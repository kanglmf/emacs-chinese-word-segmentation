;;
;; NOTE:
;;
;; The `cns-mode', if enabled, changes the following key bindings:
;;
;; +---------------+----------------------+--------------------------+
;; | key binding   | default command      | cns-mode command         |
;; +---------------+----------------------+--------------------------+
;; | M-b           | (backward-word)      | (cns-backward-word)      |
;; | M-f           | (forward-word)       | (cns-forward-word)       |
;; | C-<backspace> | (backward-kill-word) | (cns-backward-kill-word) |
;; | M-DEL         | (backward-kill-word) | (cns-backward-kill-word) |
;; | C-<delete>    | (kill-word)          | (cns-kill-word)          |
;; | M-d           | (kill-word)          | (cns-kill-word)          |
;; | M-t           | (transpose-words)    | (cns-transpose-words)    |
;; +---------------+----------------------+--------------------------+
;;
;; Similar to `backward-word' or `forward-word', prefix argument for
;; all cns-mode commands listed above is also supported.
;;
;; Keep in mind that, Chinese characters include HànZì (汉字) and
;; Chinese punctuation characters.  HànZì needs word segmentation,
;; while Chinese punctuation characters does not.
;;
;; Implementation detail:
;;
;; There are 8 situations for word movement, as illustrated below.
;; Arrow ("<-" or "->") indicates the next movement direction, ",."
;; represents non-word characters, and "I" is the cursor postion.
;;
;; Group 1: Word segmentation is probably necessary.  This means that
;; if it is the first time we met Chinese characters or the surronding
;; Chinese characters are changed, word segmentation is necessary.
;; Otherwise, recent word segmentation is used in order to speed up
;; the movement.
;;
;; +-----------+-------------+-------------------------+------------------+
;; | Situation | example     | next movement direction | desired movement |
;; +-----------+-------------+-------------------------+------------------+
;; | 1a        | 中文I分词   | <-                      | I中文分词        |
;; | 1b        | 中I文分词   | <-                      | I中文分词        |
;; | 2         | 中文分词,.I | <-                      | 中文I分词,.      |
;; | 3a        | 中文I分词   | ->                      | 中文分词I        |
;; | 3b        | 中文分I词   | ->                      | 中文分词I        |
;; | 4         | I,.中文分词 | ->                      | ,.中文I分词      |
;; +-----------+-------------+-------------------------+------------------+
;;
;; Group 2: Word segmentation is not necessary.  This means that if we
;; do normal word movement (i.e. `backward-word' or `forward-word'),
;; there is no HànZì in the region from current point to the point
;; after word movement.  Note that Chinese punctuation character is
;; not HànZì.)
